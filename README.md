# Tic-Tac-Toe-Simple-ML-Algorithm
Tic-Tac-Toe-Simple-ML-algorithm This is a school project in which I wrote the game tic tac toe in C++ and I created very simple machine learning algorithm. 
The algorithm represents saving positions and than comparing them. Every time the bot lose, it saves the loosing position without the last move of the player and in the next game it compares the position it is going to make with all saved positions. If the incoming position is equal one of the losing positions the bot changes the position it was going to make. This way if you play long enough the bot will save all the losing positions and it will be undefeatable. 
I know that there are more simple and useful algorithms for this task like the minimax algorithm but may task was to make the computer to learn with every game not to make it undefeatable from the very beginning.
